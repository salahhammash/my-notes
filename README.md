 The purpose of all software is To help people , 

Every programmer is a designer and we should work & focuse on our web-site to make it easy to use for devlopers and helpful for useres

- Your code should not be complicated & you should understanding what you are writing (code)


- Dont think that you are the most smartest in the world 
BE VERY SIPMLE PERSONE as much you can and let others learninig from you

-understand your problems then put a paln to solve it  (think before acting) ,divide the problem into smaller tasks and solve each sub-problem one by one to make it, and dont spend alot of time 

- Don’t  spend your time thinking about futuer , the code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future

-create your own invent, You need something that doesn’t exist yet

-Make your code  small & easy to understand

-When you have a bug, first you should reproduce it dont guess the source of the bug

-When you can’t make the code simpler then you should add the comment to explain this complexity (Write a comment to explain “WHY”, not to explain “WHAT”)

-pick the right technologies for your project ,don’t depend on external technologies

-Keep learning every new day dont stop it 

- dont be shy to say than you dont know how to do somthing or you dont understand it , ask for help (always seek advice) & dont be stubborn
